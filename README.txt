 === ABOUT

​A sokoban-like puzzlegame, in which you take control of a robot on a foreign planet, collecting alien gems. However, you mechanisms are dependant on the signals you get from your signal-tower and the more you distance yourself from it, the less control you have over your character.

Can you collect all the gems on this planet?
